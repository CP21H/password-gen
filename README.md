# Password Generator & Checker
The Password Generator & Checker program serves as my introductory program into working with Cybersecurity topics. The program, which serves as both a password generator and a password strength checker was originally implemented in C++, of which the original source code stored in the `main.cpp` file can be found in the `csrc` folder provided.

As a means of distributability and way to further the project, a website was created for ease of user experience. Making this website entailed translating the original source code from C++ to JavaScript.
